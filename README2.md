# JavaScript
============
A Practical Style Guide to Everyday JavaScript.

Here in lies a guide to writing principled, consistent, and idiomatic JavaScript.

There are many ways to write good JavaScript. This guide takes a strong stance on syntactic style. Whereas other guides will say, you can do things _this_ way, or _that_ way -- this guide says do it _this_ way. Though the more debatable sections will be made noted. The most important aspect of writing good JavaScript syntatically is _consistency_. Ultimately, whichever style you do choose to use, be sure to stick to it.

For the most part this guide contains a compliation of style guides from various online and book sources. Please refer to the resources section for the list of all sources for this document. I also used the MLA style for citations. Please refer to the MLA style guide for an explanation of how MLA style citations are formated.
